Description: A clinically meaningful measure of treatment effect based on
    Kendall's tau with right-censored data along with corresponding inference
    procedure. The plot of tau process is provided as a graphical tool
    for monitoring the progression. It complements another summary measures 
    under nonproportional hazards. For details, please refer to
